		<div id="story">Peter stood in the circle taking his turn to enjoy a mighty pull on the joint before passing it on to the next guy, Parker. Parker swayed drunkenly. Peter was just sick of the whole mess of it all. He felt as though he were looking at Parker through the wrong end of binoculars. Parker seemed far away, swaying in the center of a hyper-focused circle. Black hair sticking out every possible direction, glasses broken and smudged, looking to be slipping down his narrow nose. Wine colored button up, unbuttoned. White not white shirt now seen between the unbuttoned buttons. Hyper-focused on Parker as a whole, Peter took note that Parker’s torn and stained jeans were being held up by a bike tire as a belt, a belt once a bike tire. Peter felt like he’d been arm outstretched with the joint too long, yanked back the reach, took another long pull followed by an equally long cough. Later in the now, the joint back in air, mid-passing as an attempt toward Parker again. Parker looks over with eyes swimming back and forth, as if tracking twelve of Peter repeatedly passing the joint, deciding which Peter to reach for, what direction, whreee? Parker takes a stumble toward Peter. Peter notes Parker wears shoes without socks or laces and wonders how Parker could still have shoes. How Parker could have anything, really. Parker was always drunk, but Peter preferred that scene over the screen scene.</div>
